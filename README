Collatz Conjecture Calculation of number of terms.

Marlon B van der Linde <marlonv@protonmail.com>

== Manual Build

Please build on the command line with `g++`, eg, to build collatzA:

	`g++ src/collatzA/main.cpp -o bin/collatzA -std=gnu++11`

This will plae a binary into the `bin/` subdirectory, which will be executable like:
	
	`./bin/collatzA 3`

== Makefile

I really have not done this in over a decade, and will add one if it makes sense, but the project seems simple enough.


== Boilerplate

The project files are left in the repo for my convenience to work on multiple systems, and I realise they are not ideal or portable between developers.
They can be safely ignored, unless you are using CodeBlock, in which case they may be useful.
